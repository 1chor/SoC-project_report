After the bitstreams have been generated, the hardware design is exported to the Vivado SDK, which is included in the Vivado Design Suite.

Using SDK, a new \gls{fsbl} application project is created. This is done using an underlying \gls{tcl} script. To finally generate the \gls{fsbl}, proceed as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=Bash,
	%caption={Building the FSBL},
	%label={lst:makefsbl},
	basicstyle=\small,
	float=htbp,
	floatplacement=htbp
	]
cd hardware_design

# create FSBL project
make -f scripts/Makefile fsbl

# If the project has already been created, run ...
cd soc_project.sdk/fsbl/Release
make
\end{lstlisting}

The compiled \gls{fsbl} will be available at \emph{soc_project.sdk/fsbl/Release/fsbl.elf}.
