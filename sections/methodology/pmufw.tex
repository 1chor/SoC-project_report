The generation steps for the \gls{pmufw} are the same as for the \gls{fsbl}. An application project for \gls{pmufw} is also created with the SDK.

Proceed as follows to generate the \gls{pmufw}:
\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=Bash,
	%caption={Building the PMUFW},
	%label={lst:makepmufw},
	basicstyle=\small,
	float=htbp,
	floatplacement=htbp
	]
cd hardware_design

# create PMUFW project
make -f scripts/Makefile pmufw

# If the project has already been created, run ...
cd soc_project.sdk/pmufw/Release
make
\end{lstlisting}
\FloatBarrier

The compiled \gls{pmufw} will be available at \emph{soc_project.sdk/pmufw/Release/pmufw.elf}.
