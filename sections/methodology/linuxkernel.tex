Mentor Embedded provides a branch of the Linux kernel that is compatible with the ZCU102 Evaluation Kit \cite{linuxkernel}.
Source release \emph{release_android-8_xilinx-v2018.1} was used because it is compatible with the android revision. Compared to the previous project \cite{oldrepo} in which Linux kernel version $3.6$ was used, the newer kernel version $4.4$ was used.

To build the Linux kernel from \cite{linuxkernel} for the ZCU102 with Android support,
the following steps need to be followed:
\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=Bash,
	%caption={Building the Linux kernel},
	%label={lst:makelinuxkernel},
	basicstyle=\small,
	float=htbp,
	floatplacement=htbp
	]
# setup environment
export COMPILER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
export ARCH=arm64
export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-	

# load kernel config
cd mpsoc-linux-xlnx
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- xilinx_zynqmp_android_defconfig

# build
make -j4
\end{lstlisting}

The compiled image will be available in \emph{arch/arm64/boot/Image}.
