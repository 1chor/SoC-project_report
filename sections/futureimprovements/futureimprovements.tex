In this section, ideas for further projects and how to improve the current
design are presented.

\subsection{Image Processing Hardware}
Image or video processing filters, which on the one hand take up much more space on the \gls{fpga} and on the other hand have a much higher processing effort, would be a very suitable application for a partially reconfigurable \gls{iot} device. There are several cores in the Vivado IP Catalog that meet the requirements for efficient image and video processing. These cores use an \gls{axi} stream interface to connect to the rest of the fabric. In this laboratory project, these cores could not be used because no license was provided to generate a bitstream containing these cores.
